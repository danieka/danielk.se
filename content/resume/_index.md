# Résumé

## Me in a nutshell

Mid-level Full Stack Developer with intimate understanding of what goes into running a business. If you want a rundown of my skills scroll to the end. But I implore you to read the story of what formed me.

## Beginning

Hi,  

My name is Daniel. I've been a programmer at heart since I first installed Linux when I was fourteen and I fondly remember spending the first month figuring out how to configure the network and get up X and running. I also picked up some Python and since then I've been obsessed with problem solving. I've had quite a lot of different jobs: [professional tubaist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaoDoBiPXT0), teacher (high school and university) and IT support.

Being a musician taught me unwavering dedication to performance. As a musician you have to perform every time you take to the stage, no excuses. You also internalise a mentality of constant improvement, every performance can and must be improved upon. While a teacher I got comfortable speaking in public and learned how to explain technical stuff in a way that most, if not all, people will understand.

In IT support I worked in an internal call center for Stockholm's hospitals and got to see first hand how almost any bad experience can be turned to something positive by hearing, and actually listening, to the user. Even if I couldn't solve a case I could always end the call on a positive note with users feeling satisfied. I prided myself on closing 90% of my cases without needing to escalate and many days managed to be number one in answered calls. Through all these gigs I continued hacking away on evenings and weekends. I dabbled in web development, genetic algorithms and stock trading, and robotics to name a few.

Having done than stuff I started studying for my Bachelor and Masters in Computer Science at the Royal Institute of Technology and stayed there for two years and I learned enough computer science to have a foundation for all the evening and weekend hacking I had been doing. But I decided to drop out in order to found a start-up which brings me to the last three years.

## Startup Founder

While at school I co-founded a startup peerCast that I've been working with for the last three years. We've done two pivots, [Fliffr](https://www.fliffr.com) and [EagleDial](https://www.eagledial.com), but focus has always been on combining live video with pay-per-minute transactions. Since founding the company I have grown tremendously as a developer. I've been a jack of all trades and have worked with marketing, sales, accounting (kill me now, please!), and of course development.

Staying with the same product that you've helped build for three years really let's you see all the mistakes you've done and I've taken to heart how to build simple and maintainable software. YAGNI has become a personal mantra of mine. Together with my co-founders I have designed, architected, implemented and maintained both backend and frontend software. I pride myself on being able to independently solve most problems that come my way, but I also know when to ask for help because I've seen my "solutions" backfire when deployed to prod. I've become a firm believer in process. For me this means rigorous testing, routines for deployment and the least amount of manual work involved in all steps of testing and deploying software.

As a founder I've been in charged of, and executing on, everything from running AdWords campaings, to editing video, copy writing and sales calls. That means that while I'm a really good developer I also knows what it takes to make a business work. I know that revenue trumps everything and that product development never happens in a vacuum. I enjoy talking to users and being a part of closing a deal is the most exilhirating feeling I know.

# 100 bad ideas for passive income

Lately I've been fascinated with the thought of passive income. I've realised two things about myself during the last year: I don't need a lot of money to be satisfied and I value freedom - geography and time - over money. So I started thinking about different ways of earning a little money with a little effort with a high probability of success. This view is diametrically opposed to the startup approach - maybe earn a ton of money with a lot of effort and huge risk of failure. Neither approach is better than the other. But you have to decide for yourself what you want out of life.

I wanted to try out the [100:10:1](https://nickbentleygames.wordpress.com/2014/05/12/the-100-10-1-method-for-game-design/) method of generating a successful business idea. The method involves brainstorming 100 ideas, good or bad, over the course of a short period of time. After that you would work in parallel on the ten most promising ideas and only when you've worked for a while on all ten ideas would you pick one idea to go with. For products that might involve doing ten MVP:s but only making a real product out of one.

Now I don't have the time to actually build any products but I thought I might try the first step. So this is more of a way for me to record all my bad ideas, maybe I'll have some use for them someday. Or maybe you will. If you like one of the ideas feel free to use it. So here it goes, 100 bad ideas, most of which are neither passive nor income generating.

1. Make a game out of the [Edda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edda), the book of Norse mythology. The game would probably be story-driven like [Sunless Sea](http://www.failbettergames.com/sunless/) combined with a game which name I've forgotten. You played as a human, but you could be born anywhere on the planet, Sweden or Mali, and the goal was to create a good life. Basically a sandbox game aimed at showing how utterly unjust the world is. My game would involve the player being born somewhere in Midgard as a human and the goal of the game would be to die as glorious a death as possible.

2. Rent out summer cottages on Gotland. I'm guessing there is an untapped potential with a lot of small cottages being unrented due to the hassle of renting out. You could probably upsell the guests e.g. cleaning, groceries in refrigerator on arrival, rent a chef.

3. Sell [Finnish baby boxes](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22751415) in Sweden. Would involve convincing a government they should spend money on it. But packaging could probably be handled by Amazon or something like that.

4. Ticket-sharing. Meet up and exchange tickets for public transportation. Say you've bought a three day ticket but only use it the first two days, now you can sell it on to someone else.

5. Catastrophe alarm. Would involve using the GPS on users phone and detecting anomalous movement in crowds like dispersing or running.

6. Plant subscription service. For inner city residents who want their own garden where they can grow edible stuff but want none of the hassle. Deliver all earth, pots, seeds, fertiliser etc. to their doorstep.

7. Ethereum or altcoin mining.

8. Portrait painting. Let customers upload a picture of something they want painted e.g. their pet or themselves. Process image to make it look painting-y and let a printing company print and deliver it.

9. Hyper-local lending. Some webpage for letting neigbours easily lend stuff to each other. An electric screwdriver's median usage is once. Source: hearsay.

10. Personal development subscription. Somehow you could have a subscription for material and activities that will make you a better person. Idea may need more fleshing out.

11. Curated hand knitting subscription. Deliver all materials and instructions for making your own gloves and pullovers.


53. Work hard at a high-paying job, save a lot, invest.

# What I can do for you

## Software projects

I have extensive experience building products, mostly SaaS web applications. I can help you quickly develop prototypes or minimally viable products that let you explore new business ideas. I don't just deliver code, I deliver business outcomes. As a founder and entrepreneur I'm used to interacting with users and customers to elicit feedback and to then incorporate that into the product we're developing together.

Contact me and we'll discuss how I can help you kickstart your product development.

## DevOps coaching

I have a passion for helping teams deliver higher quality software, with shorter leads teams and lower levels of stress. I do this using the playbook from Accelarate. I've applied this at Flinker where I'm proud of moving our release schedule from once every other month to deploying 3-5 times per week, and we've done it with a change fail rate below 5%. Running blameless post mortems after each production incident has been key in achieving a low change fail rate. Our lead time from starting work on a task to having delivered it to production is usually below 48 hours.

I can help you make the same journey.

## Freelance developer

I have professional experience working in more than ten languages and I'm used to quickly adapting to new situations and new tools. I'm able to quickly integrate with a new team to deliver value. I have experience in frontend, backend and infrastructure.

# Daniels digital garden

Instead of writing blog posts arranged in chronological order I've decided to try to grow a digital garden. Knowledged isn't chronologically ordered, instead it is centered around subjects. And instead of a blogger I will be a gardener.

I intend to write here about subjects which interest me. Hopefully this garden will reflect my current understanding on a number of subjects. Since the garden is based on my knowledge it will most assuredly contain errors, such is the nature of human fallability. Despite that I hope that this garden will be useful to me and maybe even to you, dear reader.
